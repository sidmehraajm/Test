# ðŸ•¸ Geometry Check before Rigging

## Why does Geometry matter?

In quality character animation, all the steps in creating are equally important, starting from the design, to the animation part. \
For getting the perfect deformation one of the most important aspects is the topology of the mesh, even though there are many deformers and stuff that can help get good deformation, the basic requirement is a clean and properly distributed mesh, we'll discuss more about it in this blog

## 1. Topology

Topology matters a lot as when rigging a character not only the topology needs to be clean and properly organized but also has the flow of deformation.\
The flow of deformation means creating  the mesh flow by thinking about how it will be deformed.

### How to Check Topology

1. Switching on the Default Lighting, Wireframe on mesh, Default colour & Turning off textures to check the flow properly
2. Checking the places which are going to have extreme deformations&#x20;
3. Making sure the Normals are facing the right direction. (Tip: Switch off Two-sided lighting )

### Cleaning Up the scene

1. Switching on the Default Lighting, Wireframe on mesh, Default color & Turning off textures to check the flow properly
2. Checking the places which are going to have extreme deformations&#x20;
3. Making sure the Normals are facing the right direction. (Tip: Switch off Two sided lighting )
