# â˜¦ Transform Nodes

## Transforms (A Rigger's right hand)

> Transform nodes are [**dagNodes** ](transform-nodes.md#dag-and-dag-hierarchy)that are used to group and transform other dagNodes. **All dagNodes that are not transform nodes in Maya must exist as a child of some transform node**.



> Transformation Matrix (DAG) transform nodes have many attributes that make up the final transformation matrix as represented by the matrix attribute. This breakdown provides animators fine control over the animation of these parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to describe the order in which these attributes are applied to build the final matrix attribute.
