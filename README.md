Rigging Artists/ Aspiring Rigging Artists have been struggling for so long because there is literally no place to learn rigging properly, even Autodesk has not given much content other than some videos which are far more advanced for junior/fresher rigging artists.

We mean to create a platform which can help and make it easy for everyone to learn rigging easily with short articles and videos! We are collecting information and study materials everyday to help you find everything at one place!
